# MTD-GAN - Official Pytorch Implementation

It is currently incomplete. It will be updated in the future.

## 💡 Highlights
+ Develop a discriminator utilizing multi-task learning (MTL), which leverages three simultaneous tasks—restoration, image-level decision, and pixel-level decision—to transfer contextual, global, and local feedback between the real normal-dose and synthesized images to the generator.

+ Propose two regulations to improve the representation capabilities of the discriminator: restoration consistency (RC), which compares the discriminator's outputs from the input data with the corresponding restoration data generated by our MTL discriminator for consistency, and non-difference suppression (NDS), which excludes areas that cause confusion in discriminator decisions.

+ Design a novel generator that consists of residual fast Fourier transform with convolution (Res-FFT-Conv) blocks that fuse frequency-spatial dual-domain representations. The proposed generator effectively captures rich information by simultaneously utilizing spatial (or local), spectral (or global), and residual connections. To the best of our knowledge, this represents an inaugural effort in employing the Res-FFT-Conv block within the generator for LDCT denoising, which demonstrates the versatility of the block.

+ Evaluate our network with extensive experiments, including an ablation study and visual scoring using two distinct datasets of brain and abdominal CT images. Six metrics based on pixel- and feature-spaces were used, and the results indicated superior performances in both quantitative and qualitative measures compared to those of state-of-the-art denoising techniques.
